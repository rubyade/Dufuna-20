This is a Spring Boot Application.

Dependencies

It is connected to a MYSQL database.
This is a Java project and I used Java version 16 for this work.
It is also running on spring, favoring Maven so you need to run ./mvnw spring-boot:run to build the project.
To build on debug mode, run ./mvnw -X spring-boot:run instead
